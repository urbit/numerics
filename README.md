#   Numerical Libraries for Urbit

We envision three libraries and associated jet code living in this repository:

- Lagoon (Linear AlGebra in hOON) will offer operations in the tradition of BLAS and LAPACK (like NumPy's pure matrix operations).
- Saloon (Scientific ALgorithms in hOON) will offer transcendental functions (like NumPy's transcendental functions, optimizers, etc.).
- Maroon (MAchine LeaRning in hOON) will offer machine learning algorithms as a sidecar to Urbit.

We are also developing [SoftBLAS](https://github.com/urbit/SoftBLAS) to support software-defined jetting.
